00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:08.220
The topic of today's talk is an interesting
property of money that I want to explore with you.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.830
I'm calling this one "Inside Out."

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.580
Who here wants to tell me what the four properties
of money are?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.650
What the four primary functions of a currency
are?

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.650
Anybody?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.650
[Audience] Value exchange?

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.720
[ANDREAS] Medium of exchange, yes that's one.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.029
Store of value, that's two.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.670
[Audience] Fungibility?

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.390
[ANDREAS] That's not a use case for money,
but it's a property.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.440
Two more.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.440
Unit of account, very good.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.740
What's the fourth one?
System-of-Control (SoC).

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.440
What? I don't remember reading that.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.699
System of control.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.739
Turns out, we've had money for thousands of
years, potentially tens of thousands of years.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.300
It's really hard to tell how far back money
goes.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.519
But the money we have today is very different
from the money we've had in the past, because

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.300
something changed in the last 50 years that
has fundamentally altered the course of money,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.390
of currency, of this system of communicating
value to other people.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.000
We have the three components: medium of exchange
(MoV), unit of account (UoA), and store of value (SoV).

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.180
Those have been around for millenia.
And then something happened.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:40.130
In 1970, Richard Nixon signed the Bank Secrecy
Act and turned money into a system of control.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:49.460
A system of control that attempts to use money
as a political tool in order to control who

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.400
is able to send and receive it, who they are
able to send money to, and aims (ultimately)

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.290
to the complete surveillance of all financial
transactions worldwide.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:14.340
Complete, total, totalitarian financial surveillance.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:22.610
This change 50 years ago has gradually percolated
through every country in the world,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.080
every financial service in the world, every bank
in the world.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:39.140
In 1970, Richard Nixon deputised the financial services
field to turn them into a branch of law enforcement.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:51.240
Law enforcement beyond borders, beyond jurisdictions,
beyond due-process, beyond political and democratic

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:59.540
control, beyond recourse.
A cop can confiscate your money.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.940
A judge can sign a warrant to freeze your
accounts.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.820
A bank can do both of those things without
any authorisation from anyone

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.680
and there's nothing you can do about it.
This applies world-wide.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.700
Money as a system of control supercedes all
other functions of money.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.120
When money is turned into an enforcement tool,
the other functions start getting eroded.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:38.050
It is no longer the best medium of exchange,
because its function as a medium of exchange

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.160
is subordinate to its function as a system
of law enforcement, a system of control.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:53.349
At that point, the system of control aspect
starts corrupting everything.

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.430
We are now 25 years into the internet revolution.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.340
Smartphones, cellphones, dumb phones... data
connections have propagated out to more than

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.430
2.5 billion people who have never had these
technologies before.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.260
Where's finance? 
Lagging 15 to 20 years behind.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:25.800
It does not reach 2.5 billion people completely
unbanked, 4 billion people underbanked.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.410
Really only 1.5 billion people have the full,
privileged, elite form of banking that

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.860
we enjoy in most western liberal democracies.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:47.400
Even there, there are tiers of access and control.
How many people in this room are accredited investors?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.660
Mhm, what a lovely bunch. [Laughter]

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:03.380
That puts you in the 1/10 of 1/10
of 1/10 percentile of the world.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.280
There are tiers within the financial system.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.450
Some people who have better access, some people
who have better recourse, and some people

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.070
who have complete immunity.

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:22.540
Some people can commit crimes against millions:
robo foreclosures, Libor fraud, rigging the gold markets.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.280
And no one will ever go to jail. Why?

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.820
Because when money becomes a system of control,
financial services companies become deputies

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.700
in this system of enforcement and control.

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:44.860
As deputies, they get some perks.
One of the perks is they never go to jail.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.860
Well, with a few exceptions; there are some
fundamental rules that always apply to our society.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.020
Bernie Madoff went to jail, he made the fundamental
mistake of stealing from rich people.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.940
Don't do that!
Foreclose on 10 million poor people? No problem.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.600
Create 3.5 million fake accounts in Wells
Fargo? No problem.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.660
Lose 143 million private records of individuals
at Equifax?

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:20.880
Let's see some bets. 
How many executives are going to jail? None.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.360
A system of control corrupts the very basis
of money until it can no longer function as

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.460
a medium of exchange.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.040
And it breeds economic exclusion.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.300
We are now 25 years into the era of the internet and
we are reaching fewer people with economic inclusion.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.760
We are actually backtracking historically,
because increasingly entire countries are

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.780
being cut off from the world financial system.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.979
You don't act in the best interests of the
United States?

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.470
You lose your SWIFT code, you are no longer
part of the wire transfer network.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:07.410
You submit to the universal jurisdiction of
American courts, like Switzerland had to do,

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.330
or you lose access to international banking.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.730
You lose access to the reserve currency, you
lose access to the lifeblood.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:24.160
This devil's bargain has made financial services
unassailable from a point of competition.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:33.780
They are surrounded by a thicket of regulations;
these regulations are not about consumer protection,

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.509
consumers are most certainly not protected.

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:40.270
They are most certainly about the system of
control of money.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:47.060
They are about the law enforcement and policy
enforcement -- and sometimes straight up politics

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.780
enforcement -- that comes with money.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.240
Money does not flow freely.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:01.900
I have some bad news.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:09.100
Those gold bars surrounding the banks and
protecting them from competition are a gilded cage.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:14.760
A cage that keeps them inside a system of
regulation, that prevents competition from

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:22.009
the outside, but also prevents them from acting
with innovation in free markets, expanding

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:27.960
their business, unless they make all of that
subordinate to a system of political control.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.539
Store of value no longer works; you cannot
store value in a currency that can be confiscated

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:39.250
at whim, frozen by any banker, at any point
in time.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.029
That is not a stable store of value.

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:48.610
You cannot use it as your currency reserve
to buy oil with, as your foreign exchange

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:57.209
reserve in your country, because if you cross
the superpowers they will cut off your access.

00:08:57.209 --> 00:09:01.829
And you will not be able to use oil.

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:09.380
You cannot use money as a medium of exchange
if you cannot exchange it freely with whoever you want.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:16.120
Gradually, the corruption spreads and spreads.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:25.139
Now, something new arrives on the horizon:
a system of money that works on a network.

00:09:25.139 --> 00:09:31.619
That is first and foremost a medium of exchange,
a store of value, and one day (potentially)

00:09:31.619 --> 00:09:32.670
a unit of account.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:40.800
But it will never become a system of control;
it refuses to become a system of control.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:53.779
In fact, its design principles are neutrality,
openness, borderless access, censorship resistance.

00:09:53.779 --> 00:09:57.259
And now the banks can't play in that space.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:10:04.379
They're stuck inside their guilded cage, playing
cop for the world's superpowers.

00:10:04.379 --> 00:10:11.490
Offering economic services to a tiny fraction
of the human population.

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:22.329
Sacrificing 4 billion people on the altar
of poverty in order to create a nice, fake,

00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:30.209
bourgeois sense of security among the middle
class by selling them lies.

00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:36.449
FDIC: 'Don't worry, your money is insured.'

00:10:36.449 --> 00:10:38.009
Right?

00:10:38.009 --> 00:10:44.920
How many people here have FDIC or equivalent
insurance on their bank accounts?

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.500
How many Greeks do you think had insurance
on their bank accounts?

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:58.860
All of them. What happened to that?
Poof! in one afternoon. Vanished, with a 20% haircut.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:07.140
Whose insurance? Does it insure you or does it insure the banks? What does it insure against?

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:14.300
Small failure, not big failure. Big failure? Uninsureable.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:21.760
How many of you have money in banks?
None of you have money in banks. [Laughter]

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:32.060
I mean, please, you're lawyers.
You understand bailment. It's not your money.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.619
You have an "account," which is a legal construct
that they give you in exchange for giving them

00:11:38.619 --> 00:11:44.950
an unsecured loan of your money so that
they can finance credit to their customers.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.329
You don't own (legally) any of the money that's
in your account!

00:11:49.329 --> 00:11:56.350
You have a legal construct that possibly,
maybe entitles you to withdraw at the pace

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:05.279
that they want... unless you cross the wrong
person, go to the wrong protest, associate

00:12:05.279 --> 00:12:09.439
with the wrong organisation, vote for the
wrong party.

00:12:09.439 --> 00:12:15.759
Sure, maybe that's not happening in Canada,
but out of 194 countries this model of turning

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:20.850
money into a system of control has taken off
like wildfire.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:24.040
Because it's every dictator's wet dream.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:32.480
It ensures that political dissent can be snuffed
at the bank very effectively.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.129
It is one of the most effective systems of
control that exists.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:44.420
Now it has to face competition from a system
that will not do that, that cannot be made

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:52.679
to do that, that will not yield, that will
not be co-opted.

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:53.839
What's the response?

00:12:53.840 --> 00:13:02.640
"Heh, Bitcoin is a joke. Cryptocurrencies? They're outside the system. Nobody wants to be outside the system."

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.260
Guess what? There are 6 billion people out there.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.119
They don't want to be outside the system,
they'd much rather be inside, but they haven't

00:13:12.119 --> 00:13:16.740
been invited and they probably won't be.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:23.529
Many of them can't do the things that are
neccessary to be invited into the system.

00:13:23.529 --> 00:13:24.610
Guess what?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:32.520
There is an entire generation that has now discovered the two forms of power that come to people.

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:39.120
The first form is voice and the second form
is exit.

00:13:39.129 --> 00:13:45.369
You either speak up with your voice, express
your political will, and force change.

00:13:45.369 --> 00:13:51.470
When that doesn't work, you get to the second
most important power that all humans have.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:14:01.900
That's exit. Borders have been erected for millenia to prevent exit, to slow down exit.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:11.500
You can't easily emigrate, opt out, colonise,
depart, exit.

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:17.019
What happens when exit is not a physical act,
but a virtual act?

00:14:17.019 --> 00:14:23.459
What happens when people decide to exit from
the financial system in a virtual way?

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:29.300
Vir-exit? Bit-exit?

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:34.819
You can keep the inside of the guilded cage.

00:14:34.819 --> 00:14:45.350
It is demographically stagnated, over-leveraged,
swimming in debt, out of control, and it serves

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:49.300
a tiny sliver of the population. You can keep it.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:57.340
An entire generation of Millenials no longer
believes that fiction of bank security, of

00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:05.459
future possibility, of deferred earnings,
of interest rates, of mortgages.

00:15:05.459 --> 00:15:10.120
They will exit, they are exiting in droves.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:17.779
Not just here, but even more so in the countries
where the existing system of inside finance,

00:15:17.779 --> 00:15:23.230
of control, is used despotically, opressively.

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:27.879
China is exiting in droves and it's barely
started.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:32.609
Bitcoin has been around for nine years.

00:15:32.609 --> 00:15:36.759
What does the insider group do?

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:42.319
What do the regulators do in response to a
system that cannot be regulated?

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:53.640
They regulate the bits they can: the exchanges,
the bank accounts, the national currency side of things.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.889
They shut down the on-ramps and off-ramps.

00:15:57.889 --> 00:16:03.379
They say, "We will not let you take your money
with you."

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.959
And what do Millenials say to that?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.820
"Dude... I don't have any fucking money!

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:17.440
All I have is my creative potential, my spirit,
my productivity.

00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:24.019
I can sell that directly for bitcoin without
an exchange, without an on-ramp, without an off-ramp.

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:31.309
When I need to buy something, I'll use my
digital currency directly without re-entering

00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:35.220
your system - to which I was never invited.

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:40.540
Shut down the on-ramps, shut down the off-ramps,
and I will stay on board.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:49.860
I will stay digital. I won't touch your gilded cage anymore, because I don't need you. I exit."

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.920
Thank you.
