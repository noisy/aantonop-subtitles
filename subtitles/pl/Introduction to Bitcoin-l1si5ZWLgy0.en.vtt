00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.940
And his newest book just came out eight days ago called "The Internet of Money"

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.800
which is a masterpiece to read.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.020
Please help me welcome, Andreas Antonopoulos!

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.420
Good morning everyone!

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.080
Let's start with a quick poll here.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.420
How many of you have used a digital currency like Bitcoin at least once?

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.660
And how many of you own Bitcoin at this moment or any other digital currency?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.380
Okay, we can fix that.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.640
If you like, later on, today, come find me. I would be delighted to demonstrate to you how to set up

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360
a Bitcoin wallet on your smartphone,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.160
and I will give you your first

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.540
fraction of a bitcoin, not a whole Bitcoin,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.420
and show you how a transaction works

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.800
because Bitcoin and the digital currency revolution it has started is best

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.240
demonstrated and experienced, then explained.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.440
It's actually very difficult to explain Bitcoin. I've spent the last five years

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.880
learning how to explain Bitcoin.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640
That is my full-time job.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.440
Unfortunately, the developers keep making new stuff which I then have to explain all over again.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.920
So, for a moment, forget everything you think you know about Bitcoin.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.080
Forget everything you've heard about blockchain and let's start from basics.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.380
In 2011, I heard about Bitcoin for the first time

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.100
and my reaction was exactly the same as the reaction of everybody else who heard about Bitcoin the first time

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.380
including its founder and that reaction was: "hah, nerd money!"

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.160
That's probably just for gambling.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.600
Six months later, I heard about Bitcoin again

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.600
and this time, I read the white paper that launched this system

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.120
and my background in computer science and distributed systems allowed me to see

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.300
behind the illusion of what I thought Bitcoin was

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.580
and It blew my mind.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.520
In my life, I have now had six occasions in which I have become absolutely obsessed

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.880
with a system of technology to the point of forgetting to eat, forgetting to sleep

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.500
and consuming as much knowledge as I possibly can.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.080
My first computer when I was 10 years old,

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.960
my first programming language experience,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.360
my first modem,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.940
my first access to the web the first time I use the web browser.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.640
The first time I downloaded and installed the Linux operating system

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.640
and then Bitcoin.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:29.720
When I've discovered it, I spent four months consuming as much as I could, except food.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.260
I lost 26 pounds on the highly inadvisable diet of obsession.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.720
I have not emerged from that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.080
because I keep finding new layers of depth to understand this

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.620
and the reason it's so fascinating

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.020
is because it isn't what it appears to be at first glance.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.880
Bitcoin isn't money.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.620
The blockchain isn't a system of currency. It is a platform of trust.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:16.840
It's not a company, it's not a product, it's not a service you sign up for.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.020
it's not a currency.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.900
Currency is just the first application.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.680
It is the concept of decentralization

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.400
applied to the human communication of value.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:45.540
Because what is money? (UNINTELLIGIBLE) told us it's an illusion. It's imaginary.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.340
And the reason we don't grasp that is because it's so deeply embedded in our civilization.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.560
Money is one of the oldest technologies humanity has.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.980
It precedes writing.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.140
How do we know that?

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.160
The very first samples of writing we have are spreadsheets.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:19.400
They are tallies and ledgers of debts owed and money pre-existed that writing.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.260
You might even speculate that money had an oral tradition

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:33.780
Until it needed to invent a written tradition so writing was created for it.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.280
In the history of money that now spans tens of thousands of years,

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.420
there have been maybe five major changes.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:51.980
From pure barter exchange to the introduction of the first abstraction of value,

00:05:51.980 --> 00:06:01.320
shells, feathers, beads, nuts, stones, and then precious metals.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:11.420
And then paper money, and then plastic money, and now, network money.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:21.680
Bitcoin introduces a platform on which you can run currency as an application

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.440
on a network without any central points of control

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.120
A system completely decentralized like the Internet itself.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.740
It is not money for the Internet but The Internet of Money.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.940
And what is money?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.940
Money is a language.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:52.660
Money is a linguistic abstraction. Money is a language that we use to communicate value to each other.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.500
Money simply allows us to express value

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:09.160
and that value may have economic consequences but it also has other consequences.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.920
We use money to express and create social bonds,

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:19.180
and relationships,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.280
and associations, and to create organization.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.480
Bitcoin is the first system of money that is not controlled by any entity,

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.260
that is completely decentralized.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:49.360
And what that does is it introduces the very same things that the Internet brought to communication.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:59.080
If money is speech, if money is a language and you disconnected from all other media,

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.800
and you make it pure speech, pure content,

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.100
an Internet content type, a protocol designation

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.460
money over IP,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.980
it completely separates it from all of these previous notions of nations,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.660
sovereign issuers, institutions that control.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.660
And so we go from institution-based money to network-based money.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.180
And of course, everyone will welcome this with open arms.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.980
Not a chance.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.260
What do you think they said the first time someone was presented

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:47.480
with a gold depository certificate instead of a gold coin?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.660
They said: "Hah, that's not money!

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.780
Go away!"

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.860
What do you think happened in 1950 the first time someone showed up

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:08.100
at a motel and presented their diners club membership card and said: "I'll pay with this piece of paper!"

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.260
"That's not money. Go away!"

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.540
And now we're on the verge of a new transformation of money.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:25.380
We're on the verge of creating the first completely global,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.540
completely borderless,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.900
completely decentralized, and completely open form of money,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.900
one where you can build applications because this money is programmable,

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.260
and you don't need to ask anyone's permission to launch an application

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.580
any more than you need to ask permission to launch an application on the Internet.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.660
And the only requirement to have a successful application on The Internet of Money

00:09:53.720 --> 00:10:00.260
is two interested participants. That is your market segment and you have an application.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.020
And a million applications will flourish.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.060
When you push innovation to the edges of the network,

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.980
when you remove the requirement for permission, what happens?

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.740
Exponential explosion in innovation.

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.320
The applications that could not be built on the old systems of money

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.960
because they required permission because they required a significantly large market segment,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:32.960
because they required adoption by many, in order to be available at all.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.840
Now, none of those requirements exist.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:47.340
Anyone in the world can download an application or use even a feature phone with text messaging

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:54.400
and immediately acquire the same powers that institutions of banking have today.

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.940
And when I say anyone, that's only scratching the surface.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:08.860
Because ironically enough, not only does Bitcoin and blockchain currency not recognize borders,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:11.820
it also does not recognize people.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.460
It doesn't matter if you're a person

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:23.100
or a refrigerator, or a self-driving car.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.880
Thought-out the history of money ownership of currency required

00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:37.040
personhood either as an individual or as an association of individuals in a corporation.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.140
Bitcoin can be owned by machines,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.580
Bitcoin can be owned by software agents, machines can pay each other

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.360
and that is not just about economic activity.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.040
It's the basis for market-based security systems.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.580
It's the basis for creating bonds of authentication between devices.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.180
It's the basis of new applications that have never been done before

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:07.160
Bitcoin and blockchain technology unifies the systems of money.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.740
Today we have systems of money for small payments,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.020
systems of money for large payments.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.320
We have systems of money for payments between individuals,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.120
we have systems of money for payments between companies,

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.080
we have systems of money for payments between governments.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.320
Does that remind you of something?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.100
That's how communication used to be before the Internet.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:34.200
We had systems of communication for pictures, systems of communication for letters,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:40.720
systems of communication for short distance and long distance and the Internet came and unified all of those.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.980
What The Internet of Money does is, it creates a single network which can do

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.140
a micro transaction to a giga transaction

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.560
in seconds, anywhere in the world for any participant without permission.

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:03.560
But if you just look at the application of money, you're missing the point

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:08.540
because you can take the language, the building blocks of this platform

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:15.540
and use them to construct other languages that communicate value.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:22.880
Tokens, reward points, brand loyalty coins.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:31.900
Today there are over a thousand digital currencies using the design pattern, the recipe of Bitcoin.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.020
Most of them are junk.

00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.700
Some of them are not.

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:46.580
And over the next decade, we are going to see tens of thousands and then hundreds of thousands of coins.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:53.860
Some will have economic use, some will simply be expressions of loyalty, affiliation.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.240
They will represent items in the physical world.

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.340
The title for a house,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.560
the controlling key for a car

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.260
that can be transferred from one owner to another and five seconds later,

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.500
that owner can step into the car and drive away because the car can validate

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.480
the new standard of ownership.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:23.640
We cannot yet imagine what applications we're going to build around this.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.140
But one of the interesting things we're beginning to observe

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:36.080
is that money arises out of the social construct of Homo sapiens spontaneously.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.940
It even arises in primates.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.880
You can teach monkeys money.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.200
You can teach dolphins money.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.760
You can teach greys, parrots money.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:58.140
And they will learn how to exchange abstract tokens for food and then use them to build social relationships.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.120
They'll also invent strong-arm robbery,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.640
beat up the other monkey, take away its pebbles, eat the bananas.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.520
And we see that same thing happen in children.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.400
Toddlers invent money in kindergarten,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:24.100
blocks and rubber bands and Pokemon cards and other little tokens,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:31.040
abstractions of value that they exchanged strengthen social bonds, to express loyalty and friendship,

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.720
to learn about sharing.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.520
Children will be building currencies.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:47.620
Only this time these currencies will be global, unforgeable, and scalable on day one.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:57.440
Few years from now, Maria will be launching Maria coin in her kindergarten to compete against Joey coin

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.480
and It won't really matter to anyone.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.580
Until of course, Justin Bieber launches Justin Bieber coin and it happens to surpass the market capitalization

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:13.760
of 30 nations on this planet, and we are all writing horrified opinion editorials

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:17.160
about how the world is going to hell.

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.760
What's happening with this technology is astonishingly deep.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:36.960
And for certainly some of the companies in this room, it's a bit scary.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:43.680
Banking has never been the most innovative sector in the world

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:52.340
because there is a very careful balance between innovation and the conservative fiduciary duty

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.320
that exists in banking, that must exist when you control other people's money.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:05.560
And yet with Bitcoin, you don't control other people's money.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.620
In Bitcoin, I control my money.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:19.240
I have complete and total authority over my Bitcoin. It cannot be seized, it cannot be frozen,

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.900
it cannot be censored, my transactions cannot be intercepted, and they cannot be stopped.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:30.780
And I can do so with almost complete anonymity and so can anyone

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.680
5 minutes after they download an application

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.920
and money has changed forever and banking has changed forever.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:49.040
The idea that you can proceed in the industry of money, in the industries of commerce

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.800
and maintain the same conservative attitude

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:56.860
that has existed now for centuries

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:04.260
ever since merchants in Venice and Amsterdam

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:10.000
started issuing depository certificates and providing banking services.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.840
That is gone.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:15.820
That is gone!

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.140
You cannot operate closed systems that have borders

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:30.820
and require permission to join at a rate of innovation that is controlled by the most conservative tendencies within

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:37.200
your organization because now you are competing with a technology that enables exponential growth,

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:43.540
exponential Innovation at the edges without permission by anyone in the world.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.000
And it's not about anyone in this room

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.860
Why? We represent the privileged elite.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.740
I can go on to a brokerage account open it up online

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:03.240
and be trading on the Tokyo stock market within 12 hours in yen.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.920
That is the privilege that I have.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.860
One and a half billion people have that privilege.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:16.380
Six billion people can operate mainly in one currency

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:22.500
and perhaps have some basic banking services. Four billion people are significantly underbanked

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.060
and an astonishing two and a half billion people are completely unbanked.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.280
They will leapfrog.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.380
They will never have a relationship with a bank.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:39.320
Every single child born today

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.360
will never have a bank account.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.320
They will have a bank app.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:52.860
A bank app that doesn't give them an account. A bank app that makes them a banker,

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.900
an international banker in an app.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.260
They will not be permitted to open a bank account until they're 16 years old.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.420
By that time, I hope they will have at least

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.780
six or more years of experience with digital currencies.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:16.780
And I would like to watch them walk into a bank branch to have someone explained to them what

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.040
three to five business days means.

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:29.360
It is highly likely the children born today will never get a driving license because they'll have self-driving cars

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.200
But they will also never use paper money.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:40.720
Because by the time they get to an age where they really start using money, there is no paper money.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:48.620
It will seem as anachronistic as a fax machine or horse and buggy seems to us.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:59.200
Exponential innovation on a global basis giving access to the other six billion.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.900
They have enormous need.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.260
And this system offers them a solution.

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.540
It's not ready yet.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:18.540
It's nascent, its complex, It's impossible to use. For most people.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:28.220
In 1989, I sent my first email. In order to do so, I had to compile a version of the Unix mail program

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.120
using a C compiler and Unix command line skills.

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:40.120
I had to set it up on the command line, type out my email and that email was transmitted

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.280
across the great Internet in an astonishing three days.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:57.520
Exactly 20 years later, my mother replicated that experience with a swipe.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.180
Bitcoin today

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:08.280
and all of the currencies that are built on that recipe are just at the same level that the Internet was in 1991.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.300
Only now we have the Internet.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.980
And so the rate of exponential growth has already started.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.940
The innovation is growing at an astonishing rate.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:34.600
I spend every single day full-time trying to keep up with Bitcoin. Just one currency, and it's almost impossible.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:45.040
Do not underestimate this. Do not listen to the people who tell you that Bitcoin is just for

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:51.700
pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, and gamblers.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:56.540
Remember that they said the exact same thing about the Internet.

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:05.060
And when you give it to two or three billion people, they're not interested in those things.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.720
They're interested in sharing cat videos.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:12.400
And now we have an Internet of a billion cat videos.

00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:20.060
When you take digital currency mainstream and give it to the four billion people who have been isolated

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.680
from international finance and commerce, and you give them the opportunity to control their money

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.640
against the spotted governments and corrupt banks that are stealing from them,

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.260
you give them the opportunity

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:38.600
to control their future, you give them the opportunity to transact with everyone in the world.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:45.880
To own title on their own property in a fully transferable digital token that is recognized everywhere.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.860
Control over finance that cannot be seized frozen or censored.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:24:02.540
They will buy food, health care, sanitation, education, shelter

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.820
because that's what we do.

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.100
And they will not be denied this technology.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.460
Do not underestimate where this is going.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.800
The Internet of Money was launched on January 3rd, 2009.

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.280
It's coming. It's coming faster than you can imagine.

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:31.600
It's deeper than you can fathom. It's more sophisticated than you can immediately understand.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.360
It takes years of study just to see all of the implications.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.580
And it is a gift to the entire world.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.240
A technology that represents the sixth greatest innovation

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:54.700
in the technology of money, the most ancient technology of our civilization. Thank you.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.900
Should we do some questions? We've got plenty of time for questions.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.700
What determines the buying power of the currency?

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:21.100
How does it stabilize and what's required to stabilize it, so if I would buy some Bitcoins,

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.120
who can manipulate the value of that?

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.720
Mhm, everyone.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.960
The buying power of Bitcoin is determined in exactly the same way that the buying power of

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:36.040
the euro, the British sterling, the Japanese yen, or the US Dollar is determined through market forces

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.760
of supply and demand in international liquid markets that operate around the clock.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.260
One of the fundamental differences is that bitcoin trading never ceases.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.040
Has been going continuously for seven years the network never stops.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.440
Every ten minutes Bitcoins heart beats

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:59.620
and transactions are processed, the exchanges never close. There is no closing price for Bitcoin.

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.660
It is a rolling average and in that trading

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:08.220
a market capitalization of approximately twelve billion dollars is now traded internationally.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.080
What is twelve billion dollars for a global currency?

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:16.140
It's a guppy, swimming in shark-infested waters

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:20.340
and every trader, every whale goes in there

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:23.060
and just kicks that price around.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:30.880
So right now the experience of living on Bitcoin which I have been doing full-time for more than three years

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:33.040
is a roller coaster.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.500
It's an absolute roller coaster.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:40.060
I've seen shifts of 20 or 30 percent in a day

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.180
and yet, if you look at the long-term trend,

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.840
volume goes up, transactions go up, and volatility keeps dropping.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.680
And the beauty of it is, I can't sell that to an American. I can't sell that to a Brit.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.640
I don't need to sell it to an Argentinean. I don't need to sell it to a Brazilian.

00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:08.100
I don't need to sell it to a Venezuelan

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:12.120
I went to a conference and an Argentinian told me

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:19.460
I'm not worried about volatility, our currency has volatility like this.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:26.240
Bitcoin has volatility like this. I'd rather be going in that direction.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:31.080
And you don't need to tell them why.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:38.780
Their government through people out of airplanes not more than 35 years ago for disagreeing.

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:44.000
They already know why the separation of state and money is a good idea.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.860
And so volatility is relative.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.920
Any other questions, come on. Yeah?

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.680
Let's get a microphone to you one second.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:11.780
Thanks, a great speech. Obviously, it sounded a little bit like one side of the coin, so we also read

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:19.560
all these you know big hacks, and I don't know, Bitfinex, you know they, I think they stole 40% of the money.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.520
I think also this autonomous organization has been hacked

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:28.560
and all these things. Can you just reflect a little bit on the dark side or

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.200
of those aspects that might not win our full trust into this evolution.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.740
Absolutely.

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:43.040
The steering wheel was not invented until 30 years after the automobile was introduced.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.320
Why? Because the first automobiles had two leather straps that you pulled left or right

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.300
to move the car, to steer the car.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:58.540
They used horse reins to steer cars.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:01.320
That's called skeuomorphic design.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:08.880
It means keeping a shadow of the former past in your new system, failing to see the new dimension

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.600
and replicating the past.

00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:17.240
Here's a currency that is not centralized where your money is your money.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:20.700
Your keys, your money.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:25.080
Not your keys, not your money.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:29.500
So, what is the first thing we do with this new system?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:40.180
We build centralized institutional's of custodial control that take other peoples money and hold it for them.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.120
Well, guess what? The entire history of banking,

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.680
the entire system of regulation and oversight is based on the simple

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.720
centuries-old understanding that when somebody else holds your money,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.580
chances are they're going to run away with it.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:02.920
And the entire system of regulation is designed to prevent that and yet it still happens all the time.

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:09.420
In hedge funds, in banks, in national currencies, all the time.

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.920
And so of course, if you replicate custodial accounts,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.520
exchanges that take other people's Bitcoin and concentrate it

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:23.420
It happens again, even worse because there are no oversight and regulations in most of these spaces.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:26.140
The answer is really simple.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:32.660
Stop centralizing the decentralized currency. Stop trying to replicate the banking past

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.920
in the future of money.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.660
And the important thing to realize is that

00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.660
security in Bitcoin is an emergent property

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:50.900
that exists because of the decentralization of control and power. If I want to hack a million customers Bitcoin,

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.400
And they're holding their keys, I have to hack a million customers.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.360
If they all give their keys to one person or one organization,

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.940
then we've got a honeypot.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.580
A honeypot that attracts the attention of every hacker on the planet.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.100
And notice what's happened.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:17.420
Over seven years and with a market capitalization of twelve billion dollars,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:22.940
Bitcoin is the largest cryptographic deployment in the world,

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:29.940
the largest public key infrastructure in the world, the largest security honeypot in the world

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.080
and it is not secure because it doesn't get attacked.

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:40.620
It is secure because it generates immunity by being attacked all the time,

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.620
24 hours a day by the most sophisticated attackers this planet has.

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:58.000
And if you in that environment set up a centralized custodial exchange using PHP and MySQL

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:02.600
and you park a 150 million dollar Honeypot in there,

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.360
you're inviting the sharks.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.080
Bitcoin banks get hacked, Bitcoin exchanges get hacked,

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:19.420
Bitcoin has not been hacked and cannot be hacked because there is no point of control

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.260
that you can apply pressure on. It's completely decentralized.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.980
All right, Maybe one more question.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.620
Where does the supply of Bitcoin come from and are you sure the market doesn't get oversupplied?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.500
The supply of Bitcoin is determined algorithmically

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:42.220
based on a geometrically declining supply function, meaning that,

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:47.080
in the beginning every 10 minutes, 50 new Bitcoin are created,

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:53.860
so every block, the heartbeat, 10 minutes, created 50 new Bitcoin.

00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:00.140
This Bitcoin is used as a reward in a game theory based security model

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:04.900
that ensures that every transaction is independently validated by completely anonymous actors

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:09.980
who have to stake electricity as a guarantee of the security work they've done

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.700
and if they succeed in doing the security work validating transactions correctly,

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.300
they earn as a reward based on a probabilistic return.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.380
That reward, 50 Bitcoin every 10 minutes. That's how currency is introduced into the economy.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.740
Every four years it gets cut in half.

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.440
50 to 25 in November of 2012.

00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:38.720
And this year in July, this past July, we had our second having event

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.600
which was celebrated with birthday parties all over the world

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.240
and Bitcoins reward went from 25 to 12.5 Bitcoin.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.540
As a system, it's designed to have a monetary policy that is purposely deflationary

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:57.660
and simulates the issuance of precious metals.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:03.040
It gets harder and harder and harder to mine gold at greater and greater and greater cost.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:09.520
And Bitcoin is the same. The idea being that less and less is issued over time.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:16.940
If you follow that geometric curve, at some point, you reach the end. In the year 2141

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.980
Bitcoin is no longer issued.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:26.580
21 million coins is the asymptotic cap. It will never reach 21 million coins.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:30.300
That is part of the protocol, it is an unchangeable part of the protocol

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:35.540
and it is a rule enforced by every system that participates in the Bitcoin network.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.180
It is meant to be sound money

00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:44.800
but it's not the only monetary policy that exists.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.620
There are several other currencies that implement different monetary policies.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:56.960
The idea is really for Bitcoin to serve as a very very solid reserve currency for many other things.

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.680
What do you have to give to companies here

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:09.300
who are from non-financial institutions about how they should take tactical steps to think about

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.960
experimenting with the blockchain in terms of storing value?

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:22.440
I think understanding that it's not just currency, understanding that it is a platform for trust.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:29.260
Understanding that it can be used as a historical record of truths that can register information

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:33.780
that it can be used to create all kinds of tokens that can be exchanged

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.820
between your customers, your suppliers, your manufacturers,

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:42.600
that it can also be used simply as a currency for any cross-border transactions

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.520
import/export activities, remittances based flows, paying associates and affiliates.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.880
All of the things that today are expensive, slow, and difficult

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.780
become cheap, fast, and easy when you use one of these digital currencies.

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.580
But It's still early. For now, learning about it.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:08.100
Here's the one important thing you must understand. You will hear a lot about blockchain

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:16.000
and most of what you hear about blockchain is not The Internet of Money. It is The Intranet of Money.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:23.600
The Intranet is where you run FrontPage and Outlook and antiquated software in a closed little

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.540
enclave of your corporate back waters with stale content and boring apps.

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:34.240
And in the end, it's full of viruses anyway because you can't keep it secure.

00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:41.780
Blockchain that is not open, that is not public, that is not borderless that is not open for innovation

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:47.520
is not what we're talking about here. And that's a really important distinction.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:53.500
It may be useful if you want to run a clearing house between three banks, maybe.

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:57.140
But it's not The Internet of Money.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.580
Thank you.

00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:11.420
Thank you so much.
